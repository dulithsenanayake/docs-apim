# Validate Request with Open Policy Agent (OPA)

The [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://openpolicyagent.org/) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement. In Choreo Connect, you can offload some responsibility of making the decision to authorize or not when a consumer invokes APIs based on policies attached to APIs.

Choreo Connect uses OPAâ€™s policy evaluation REST API interface to communicate with OPA. Following diagram describes the request/response of OPA validation.

!!! tip
    You can deploy OPA server as a sidecar with Choreo Connect Runtime (Enforcer and Router) in a Kubernetes deployment, if you want to improve communication between Enforcer and OPA server.
